# Mimic the inspector panels in Apple's Pages

![](https://dagronf.github.io/art/projects/DSFPropertyPanes/full.gif) ![](https://dagronf.github.io/art/projects/DSFPropertyPanes/panel_simple.gif)

## Features

* Basic inspector pane. Show and hide panes
* Configurable from interface builder as inspectables
* Optional supply a view as a header view
* Optional automatic scroll view support
* Optional animation
* Optional separators or bounding boxes
* Show or hide individual panes
* Expand or contract individual panes

## Why?

I've fought with this on a number of projects. I finally decided to make a drop-in class that would do everything that I wanted.  This class is fully autolayout managed.

I really like Apple 'Pages' implementation which allows having a header view which can be used to configure items even when the pane itself is hidden.  A good example of this is the 'Spacing' inspector pane, where when the pane is hidden the user can still change the line spacing at a lower granularity.

## Installation

### Direct

Copy the swift files from the `DSFInspectorPanes` subfolder to your project

### CocoaPods

Add the following to your `Podfiles` file

```ruby
pod 'DSFInspectorPanes', :git => 'https://github.com/dagronf/DSFInspectorPanes'
```

## API

### Create

1. Create an instance of `DSFInspectorPanesView` and add it to a view, or
2. Use Interface Builder to add a custom view, and change the class to `DSFInspectorPanesView`

### Properties

* `animated`: Animate the expanding/hiding of the panes
* `usesScrollView`: Embed the panes view in a scroll view
* `showSeparators`: Insert a separator between each pane
* `titleFont`: Set the font to use for the title for the panes
* `spacing`: Set the vertical spacing between each pane

### Methods

#### Add

Add a new inspector pane to the container

```swift
@objc public func add(
   title: String,                        // The title of the pane
   view: NSView,                         // The property pane to display
   headerAccessoryView: NSView? = nil,   // If the pane has a header view, the view
   canHide: Bool = true,                 // Can the pane be expanded/hidden?
   expanded: Bool = true                 // Is the property pane hidden by default?
```

Example :-

```swift
var propertyPanes = DSFInspectorPanesView(frame: .zero,
                                          animated: true,
                                          embeddedInScrollView: false,
                                          titleFont: NSFont.systemFont(ofSize: 13))

var inspectorView = NSView()       // <--- your inspector pane view
var inspectorHeaderView = NSView()  // <--- your inspector pane header view
	
propertyPanes.add(
   title: "My inspector Pane", 
   view: inspectorView,
   headerAccessoryView: inspectorHeaderView,
   expanded: true)
}
```

### Pane access

You can access the panes using the `panes` variable on the class which returns the panes as an array of `DSFInspectorPaneProtocol`

#### Expand an existing pane

```swift
var propertyPanes = DSFInspectorPanesView()
...
func expandFirstPane(shouldExpand: Bool) {
	propertyPanes.panes[1].expanded = shouldExpand
}
```

#### Show or hide a pane

```swift
var propertyPanes = DSFInspectorPanesView()
...
func hideFirstPane(shouldHide: Bool) {
	propertyPanes.panes[1].hide = shouldHide
}
```
